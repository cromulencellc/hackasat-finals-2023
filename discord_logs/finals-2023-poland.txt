2023-06-29 20:31:45.736000+00:00 - Vito: # Welcome to Hack-A-Sat Finals chat!

1. These guidelines do not supersede the official rules; they‚Äôre here to make chatting in Slack useful and productive for all of us.
2. The goals of these channels are to address hardware, infrastructure, and other gameplay issues.
3. You should have access to both #finals-2023 and #finals-2023-TEAMNAME . Please let Mission Control know if you don‚Äôt! Do that now!
4. All #finals-2023 and #finals-2023-TEAMNAME conversations will be made public after the game ends. Don‚Äôt chat anything you wish to keep private. Don‚Äôt chat personally identifiable information.
5. Please be thoughtful with which team members engage in communication with organizers. While we don‚Äôt want your team to miss important details due to someone taking a break or being busy, we also don‚Äôt want to spend a bunch of time getting confused or de-conflicting what more people want. 
6. That said, it‚Äôs totally okay to have your whole team in both the #finals-2023 and #finals-2023-TEAMNAME rooms reading.
7. Sending private or direct messages to a game operator will make it more difficult for operators and other members of your team to know what‚Äôs going on. Please don‚Äôt. 
8. Both #finals-2023 and #finals-2023-TEAMNAME can be used for official communication through the end of Hack-A-Sat finals. shout@hackasat.com is also still available for official communication. 
9. Please review the contest rules and keep an eye out for updates at https://www.hackasat.com/

2023-07-31 21:41:53.103000+00:00 - Bonus: @Vito 2 questions about VPN:
1) can subnets change? (asking if the finals VPN config will change)
2) will IPv6 be required or IPv4 is sufficient?
2023-08-11 15:59:54.579000+00:00 - Cydonia: Good morning.
Your api key is: panda-cyborg-keto-lorentz
2023-08-11 16:06:05.783000+00:00 - mkow: FYI: https://moonlighter-facts.dc31.satellitesabove.me/ gives 404, works only on HTTP
2023-08-11 16:06:23.010000+00:00 - mkow: which is quite annoying, because browsers nowadays forcefully redirect to your 404 page
2023-08-11 16:11:23.806000+00:00 - Vito: seen

2023-08-11 17:51:45.337000+00:00 - gynvael: @meenmachine `../../../` into proc/self, get the exec, analyze, use api to list files / read flag
2023-08-11 17:53:03.864000+00:00 - mkow: how should we get the mapping of IDs to services? (e.g. that ID==0 is GPS) is guessing / reversing this part of the CTF?

2023-08-11 18:24:30.265000+00:00 - Cydonia: feedback on script running for the dropped contact. It looks like you didnt give us a script to upload for the contact. If you think you should have please let me know and we can verify that you are using script upload correctly.
2023-08-11 18:25:40.758000+00:00 - Szkalom: ee we did?
2023-08-11 18:26:15.776000+00:00 - Szkalom: we uploaded script number 0 with a slightly modified example script
2023-08-11 18:26:31.783000+00:00 - Szkalom: (before the previous contact)
2023-08-11 18:26:39.038000+00:00 - Cydonia: i dont see it, let me come over to the table and we can do a quick test ok
2023-08-11 18:26:47.426000+00:00 - Cydonia: i just need to give everyone their feedback first
2023-08-11 18:26:51.813000+00:00 - Cydonia: im the guy in the hat
2023-08-11 18:26:51.877000+00:00 - Szkalom: sure üôÇ
2023-08-11 18:28:28.112000+00:00 - SafeMode: yeah i see it for next contact
2023-08-11 18:29:39.817000+00:00 - Szkalom: that's a new script üòâ
2023-08-11 18:29:43.683000+00:00 - Szkalom: hopefully a better one
2023-08-11 18:34:50.999000+00:00 - mkow: just for the record, what we discussed with @Cydonia in person: we submitted a script also for the previous round and the API succeeded, but it seems it disappeared on your side
2023-08-11 18:36:27.015000+00:00 - Cydonia: thanks for capturing this here
2023-08-11 18:45:47.484000+00:00 - mkow: > It gives you the flight software for free
is this different than `fsw.zip`? i.e. should we spend time attacking the web interface further?
2023-08-11 18:47:11.980000+00:00 - Cydonia: confirming i  saw a second script upload come through for you
2023-08-11 20:11:47.806000+00:00 - mkow: will we receive (and how) telemetry/logs/anything from the last round?
2023-08-11 20:16:53.325000+00:00 - Cydonia: @mkow ill answer this in just a sec, helping someone really quick
2023-08-11 20:24:17.596000+00:00 - Cydonia: @mkow since we just got the command loads up we will be releasing telemetry after the next contact (assuming of course that the link is good). We'll have the info on how to access that soon
2023-08-11 20:26:50.634000+00:00 - mkow: did any other team receive any telemetry so far?
2023-08-11 20:37:00.705000+00:00 - meenmachine: Answered in finals
2023-08-11 22:28:41.662000+00:00 - mkow: we extracted credentials for webserver from the password manager, but webserver was solvable via LFI
2023-08-11 22:28:45.371000+00:00 - mkow: we're confused
2023-08-11 22:31:33.959000+00:00 - SafeMode: There were multiple paths to solving the webserver. Originally it was meant to gate some of the space challenges but we decided to not do that given the contact schedule with Moonlighter.
2023-08-11 23:58:42.491000+00:00 - gregg: hey, is there a limit on the length of the LUA script?
2023-08-12 00:01:07.030000+00:00 - Cydonia: yes - the api should issue an error to you if you send a script over the max length. The reason for this is becuase we need to make sure the number of total bytes we have to upload will make it up during a single contact
2023-08-12 00:01:26.986000+00:00 - Cydonia: it shouldnt respond with 200 if you are within the max length
2023-08-12 00:01:42.614000+00:00 - Cydonia: if you think it is please lmk and ill come over, you can show me
2023-08-12 00:02:06.735000+00:00 - Cydonia: im in the hat
2023-08-12 00:02:40.225000+00:00 - gregg: thanks, we'll try and let you know
2023-08-12 00:03:19.164000+00:00 - Cydonia: if you want i can also just validate if we got the script on our end or not
2023-08-12 00:24:12.642000+00:00 - gregg: we've uploaded the scripts (3 of them), we'll have one more probably
2023-08-12 00:24:21.130000+00:00 - gregg: if you could please check if they are there
2023-08-12 00:38:40.616000+00:00 - Cydonia: gotem
2023-08-12 01:23:15.102000+00:00 - mkow: what is the exact condition to score a flag in Script Kiddie? the description says that just running anything is enough, but we found that there's also a command (id=3) named script_kiddie we can execute, which doesn't really do anything, but we guess we should just execute it with an arbitrary argument?
2023-08-12 01:24:51.800000+00:00 - SafeMode: we believe we clarified this earlier. the script kiddie message must be sent in tlm to get flag
2023-08-12 01:25:08.462000+00:00 - Cydonia: also we should have scoring info on this contact for this
2023-08-12 01:27:54.721000+00:00 - mkow: where/when was this clarified exactly?
2023-08-12 01:28:38.385000+00:00 - Cydonia: i can look if u want. but ill probably do that after the upcoming contact. want to make sure we get tlm down
2023-08-12 01:30:00.799000+00:00 - Cydonia: just lmk
2023-08-12 01:30:31.688000+00:00 - mkow: please do, we're still confused what are we supposed to do exactly in the challenge
2023-08-12 01:30:44.767000+00:00 - Cydonia: np
2023-08-12 01:30:51.681000+00:00 - mkow: there is no precise condition for scoring the flag anywhere
2023-08-12 01:30:58.356000+00:00 - Cydonia: right after we deal with moonlighter
2023-08-12 01:31:03.033000+00:00 - mkow: feel quite guessy :/
2023-08-12 01:31:03.709000+00:00 - mkow: sure
2023-08-12 01:31:23.744000+00:00 - mkow: especially that testing a single solution and getting feedback seem to take a day
2023-08-12 01:31:39.199000+00:00 - Cydonia: the 4 hr comms blackout is killer
2023-08-12 01:31:41.798000+00:00 - Cydonia: üò¶
2023-08-12 01:31:55.531000+00:00 - Cydonia: frustrating for us too
2023-08-12 01:32:08.074000+00:00 - mkow: yeah, but here you could just say exactly what's the scoring condition
2023-08-12 01:32:21.790000+00:00 - mkow: the task description suggests something else than the code
2023-08-12 01:32:34.631000+00:00 - mkow: and we won't have too many tries for it
2023-08-12 01:32:43.466000+00:00 - Cydonia: brb contact starting
2023-08-12 01:32:48.874000+00:00 - mkow: so we really have to rely on your textual description of the goal
2023-08-12 01:41:28.796000+00:00 - gregg: In 20 minutes we do have a deadline for overnight submission. when window reservations will be open?
2023-08-12 01:42:02.068000+00:00 - Cydonia: i see them as open
2023-08-12 01:42:22.328000+00:00 - Cydonia: please confirm
2023-08-12 01:42:29.640000+00:00 - Szkalom: because it's broken üòÑ
2023-08-12 01:42:41.181000+00:00 - Szkalom: I mean doesn't respond
2023-08-12 01:42:54.529000+00:00 - Cydonia: ?? can u show me if i come over ??
2023-08-12 02:35:02.853000+00:00 - Cydonia: @mkow bear with me im tired üôÇ  im pretty sure what im referring to finals-2023 from meenmachine at 10:44pdt 11:05 pdt. We have a few contacts before we let moonlighter do the really long run and should have scoring updates for folks soon. Thanks for beng patient with my response
2023-08-12 02:36:01.293000+00:00 - Cydonia: sorry again on the delay getting back to you
2023-08-12 02:47:45.127000+00:00 - mkow: > The intent of script kiddies is to reverse engineer
2023-08-12 02:49:06.273000+00:00 - mkow: dunno, there's no clear condition for scoring the flag in the code
2023-08-12 02:50:29.821000+00:00 - meenmachine: Here are your script logs
2023-08-12 02:50:37.566000+00:00 - Cydonia: understood - ill talk to the rest of the team about clarifying. we've got a few contacts we have to prioritize so we can get scoring tlm. thanks for again for waiting.
2023-08-12 02:52:04.135000+00:00 - gregg: just to clarify, which operation window is that? rest of the windows will come later?
2023-08-12 02:57:17.579000+00:00 - meenmachine: These are all the windows up until the latest ACB upload. So windows 42 and 43.
2023-08-12 04:23:21.141000+00:00 - Cydonia: your score for this is up üôÇ
2023-08-12 04:25:18.224000+00:00 - mkow: thx!
2023-08-12 15:08:44.518000+00:00 - Szkalom: Can we get a confirmation: the limitations on the pointing were in place only for the night window? Can we issue pointing commands today and they will be executed?
2023-08-12 15:28:37.680000+00:00 - SafeMode: @Szkalom  no pointing commands were only executed during the overnight window. All other pointing commands will have no effect/ this is die to spacecraft limitations due to issue with one of the reaction wheels
2023-08-12 15:31:01.284000+00:00 - Vito: clarifying: pointing commands were only executed during the overnight window
2023-08-12 15:31:21.338000+00:00 - Vito: future pointing commands will not be executed
2023-08-12 15:31:58.198000+00:00 - Szkalom: Thanks!
2023-08-12 15:37:13.287000+00:00 - Szkalom: Yes, this is what we wanted to confirm üôÇ so that there is no point trying to take photos any more
2023-08-12 16:01:14.223000+00:00 - SafeMode: @Szkalom if your has already scored points for silver medal and halide medal then yes that is true.
2023-08-12 16:06:18.397000+00:00 - Szkalom: Well no, because without pointing were can't target anything
2023-08-12 16:06:31.019000+00:00 - Szkalom: So you can only score silver, which we have
2023-08-12 16:07:08.742000+00:00 - Szkalom: Unless halide is for any photo inside geofence, but description was that it has to be a valid target
2023-08-12 16:09:32.354000+00:00 - Szkalom: So are there points for any photo inside geofence even if it is not a target?
2023-08-12 16:11:31.813000+00:00 - Cydonia: your initial read was correct. Halide medal is a picture of **specifically** a geofenced target.
2023-08-12 16:30:11.220000+00:00 - Szkalom: thanks for clarification üôÇ
2023-08-12 17:15:32.895000+00:00 - gregg: question regarding GPS and its API: are we able to download any logs from GPS? we've tried using udp.receive() bo no data was received there
2023-08-12 17:59:39.484000+00:00 - mkow: what are the exact scoring rules for Unintended Bug? should we just take _any_ photo of the forbidden area?
2023-08-12 18:00:22.752000+00:00 - gregg: or any photo inside geofenced area but not pointing to the target?
2023-08-12 18:01:04.850000+00:00 - gregg: the question is if we take a picture without pointing (which we can't do today) inside geofenced area, we would get points or not
2023-08-12 18:01:16.598000+00:00 - Cydonia: I understand the question üôÇ answering in the finals-2023 now
2023-08-12 18:03:38.377000+00:00 - Cydonia: @mkow lmk if that clarifies?
2023-08-12 18:04:23.690000+00:00 - gynvael: one more question is whether that task is achievable in the remaining windows, as the sat can't be rotated?
2023-08-12 18:04:54.762000+00:00 - gregg: I thinkg it is clear, that means that it is not possible to score them at all today
2023-08-12 18:05:24.792000+00:00 - mkow: yes üôÇ so, it means that these tasks can't be scored anymore?
2023-08-12 18:05:33.147000+00:00 - gregg: clarification why we are asking: we are trying to understand which tasks could possibly be solved today so we know what we can do today
2023-08-12 18:06:05.327000+00:00 - mkow: <searching for a vodka bottle in my backpack>
2023-08-12 18:10:51.410000+00:00 - Cydonia: plz share lol jk
2023-08-12 18:12:22.111000+00:00 - mkow: joking, but will smuggle a bottle in the afternoon
2023-08-12 18:12:27.009000+00:00 - mkow: or after we score iron ;P
2023-08-12 18:15:07.360000+00:00 - msm: happy to share a vodka (or beer) after the ctf today üòÖ (but i guess for you work continues overnight again)
2023-08-12 18:15:41.161000+00:00 - msm: we just need some iron now and we're set
2023-08-12 18:16:48.226000+00:00 - Cydonia: we will have a short break to chat with you all after the game ends and before the post game moonlighter contacts
2023-08-12 18:17:02.494000+00:00 - Cydonia: stop by and say hi
2023-08-12 18:28:50.022000+00:00 - mkow: and drink a shot
2023-08-12 18:31:08.692000+00:00 - gregg: do we know when slot reservations for round 46 will open? we want a specific slot and not want spam the "reserve" API all the time üôÇ
2023-08-12 18:36:55.472000+00:00 - Rodbert: Hey @Cydonia can you add user `mak_._` to the finals channel and to this chanel, pls üôÇ
2023-08-12 18:37:24.251000+00:00 - Cydonia: ummm ill ask someone else üôÇ
2023-08-12 18:37:59.628000+00:00 - meenmachine: Could you @ the username in this channel please
2023-08-12 18:38:30.762000+00:00 - Bonus: @<915682734138073158>

2023-08-12 18:38:48.759000+00:00 - Bonus: close
2023-08-12 18:38:54.486000+00:00 - meenmachine: Almost there
2023-08-12 18:38:57.081000+00:00 - meenmachine: You get two more tries
2023-08-12 18:39:10.838000+00:00 - Bonus: @mak
2023-08-12 18:39:15.298000+00:00 - Bonus: there we go
2023-08-12 18:39:19.142000+00:00 - meenmachine: Added haha
2023-08-12 18:39:31.162000+00:00 - mak: ahoy ;]
2023-08-12 18:39:47.530000+00:00 - meenmachine: üëã
2023-08-12 19:20:02.388000+00:00 - Vito: ü•∫
2023-08-12 19:34:25.449000+00:00 - Szkalom: Is there some estimation on "how long taking picture takes"?
2023-08-12 19:34:41.081000+00:00 - Szkalom: If we want to snap few in sequence what should be the delay between them?
2023-08-12 19:41:19.794000+00:00 - Cydonia: give me a minute - discussing
2023-08-12 19:43:38.030000+00:00 - Szkalom: And also to confirm what was said on the meeting before the CTF: the satellite is pointing downwards (nadir) all the time? üôÇ
2023-08-12 19:48:17.291000+00:00 - Cydonia: both answers in finals-2023
2023-08-12 19:49:18.678000+00:00 - Szkalom: rip, we had an idea to snap a photo when satellite is flying almost perfectly overhead (it's possible in current slot 0 and 2)
2023-08-12 19:49:34.481000+00:00 - Szkalom: which *could* work if it was pointing down üôÇ
2023-08-12 19:50:06.482000+00:00 - Cydonia: yeah i figured thats what you wanted to try
2023-08-12 19:50:21.940000+00:00 - Szkalom: there is a 89 elevation pass in slot 0 and 2 üòâ
2023-08-12 19:50:30.759000+00:00 - Cydonia: nice
2023-08-12 20:23:16.398000+00:00 - Szkalom: actually this would have been a really good challenge -> snap foto of  target but you can't control attitude, maybe an idea for future üòâ
2023-08-12 20:25:47.741000+00:00 - Cydonia: agreed
2023-08-12 20:26:15.519000+00:00 - Cydonia: the zwheel stickiness really made running our imaging challenges way harder than they were suppsoed to be
2023-08-12 20:27:31.447000+00:00 - Szkalom: but it would be cool astrodynamics chall to take photo without it üòâ just compute precise time for 90 degree overhead flight üòâ
2023-08-12 20:27:51.004000+00:00 - Bonus: just FYI, on the laser thingy above you there's a typo in our team name `Polanda Can Into Space`
2023-08-12 20:28:41.134000+00:00 - Cydonia: our bad
2023-08-12 20:28:47.470000+00:00 - meenmachine: Working as intended
2023-08-12 20:29:26.056000+00:00 - meenmachine: thats a joke. We'll tell the right people
2023-08-12 20:30:07.803000+00:00 - Cydonia: i didnt even notice there were lasers above us
