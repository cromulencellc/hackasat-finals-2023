2023-06-29 20:31:49.093000+00:00 - Vito: # Welcome to Hack-A-Sat Finals chat!

1. These guidelines do not supersede the official rules; they‚Äôre here to make chatting in Slack useful and productive for all of us.
2. The goals of these channels are to address hardware, infrastructure, and other gameplay issues.
3. You should have access to both #finals-2023 and #finals-2023-TEAMNAME . Please let Mission Control know if you don‚Äôt! Do that now!
4. All #finals-2023 and #finals-2023-TEAMNAME conversations will be made public after the game ends. Don‚Äôt chat anything you wish to keep private. Don‚Äôt chat personally identifiable information.
5. Please be thoughtful with which team members engage in communication with organizers. While we don‚Äôt want your team to miss important details due to someone taking a break or being busy, we also don‚Äôt want to spend a bunch of time getting confused or de-conflicting what more people want. 
6. That said, it‚Äôs totally okay to have your whole team in both the #finals-2023 and #finals-2023-TEAMNAME rooms reading.
7. Sending private or direct messages to a game operator will make it more difficult for operators and other members of your team to know what‚Äôs going on. Please don‚Äôt. 
8. Both #finals-2023 and #finals-2023-TEAMNAME can be used for official communication through the end of Hack-A-Sat finals. shout@hackasat.com is also still available for official communication. 
9. Please review the contest rules and keep an eye out for updates at https://www.hackasat.com/

2023-08-11 16:30:46.051000+00:00 - carlomara: Thanks again and sorry that we got several fragmented requests

2023-08-11 16:36:44.895000+00:00 - carlomara: appreciated
2023-08-11 18:03:30.798000+00:00 - drw0if: Can @lorenz join this channel?
2023-08-11 18:08:14.751000+00:00 - Deadwood: that user has the correct roles to be in this channel.
2023-08-11 18:09:20.845000+00:00 - Vito: i did it
2023-08-11 18:09:23.150000+00:00 - Vito: it was me
2023-08-11 18:25:53.010000+00:00 - Cydonia: Feedback on your scripts this script would have generated an extra gps telemetry packet at the time it was triggered and would have completed running. the print statement would go to the log that we would have provided to you after the next contact
2023-08-11 18:33:03.237000+00:00 - carlomara: Hey orga, we have some questions on schatterburg
1. Can we run the AOCS and the camera in parallel? I assume they are on separate bus. We are aware it might not be a good idea/we have to do it carefully,
2. Do you have some more accurate AOCS lock and Camera lock times than the one provided on the pdf/presentation form yesterday?
2023-08-11 18:33:17.047000+00:00 - carlomara: I forwarded, we are looking into it
2023-08-11 18:34:25.332000+00:00 - drw0if: thanks
2023-08-11 18:53:01.111000+00:00 - carlomara: Hey orga, we are trying to run the simulator to test/debug iron-bank
2023-08-11 18:53:48.728000+00:00 - carlomara: The image you provided seems to be missing some stuff:
1. the bios
2. Could not find 32MB SPI-NOR flash image: /images/nor_ztex213_has_cib.img
can you confirm?
2023-08-11 18:54:09.132000+00:00 - SafeMode: yes see @finals-2023
2023-08-11 18:54:25.502000+00:00 - SafeMode: the emulation is not intended for full system emulation
2023-08-11 18:54:39.190000+00:00 - SafeMode: that file was intentionally not provided as it is not needed
2023-08-11 18:55:13.022000+00:00 - carlomara: ack, thanks for the fast reply
2023-08-11 18:55:28.797000+00:00 - SafeMode: thanks let us know if you have more questions, sorry for confusion
2023-08-11 18:55:49.791000+00:00 - carlomara: We still have the one from 11:33
2023-08-11 18:56:02.867000+00:00 - carlomara: That's related to scatterbug
2023-08-11 18:56:29.912000+00:00 - SafeMode: you can run then at the same time
2023-08-11 18:57:03.620000+00:00 - SafeMode: but your points are valid on how you need to handle your execution
2023-08-11 18:58:17.804000+00:00 - carlomara: Yes we understand execution is key, we just had some questions on the hw capabilities. Do you have some figures for point two? If not we can base everything off the docs
2023-08-11 18:59:24.246000+00:00 - SafeMode: working on point two
2023-08-11 18:59:38.221000+00:00 - SafeMode: what are your hw quetions?
2023-08-11 19:00:11.875000+00:00 - carlomara: One that you answered and two
2023-08-11 19:00:21.828000+00:00 - carlomara: K, let me know when you can about 2
2023-08-11 19:01:27.495000+00:00 - SafeMode: see this link. http://moonlighter-facts.dc31.satellitesabove.me/docs/acs.zip
2023-08-11 19:01:51.923000+00:00 - SafeMode: there are quaternion profiles in that drop. the time periods in those files are the valid time periods for commanding the ADCS. There is one file for each available window
2023-08-11 19:02:33.453000+00:00 - SafeMode: this is the answer for point 2, btw
2023-08-11 19:03:15.310000+00:00 - carlomara: amazing, thanks a lot
2023-08-11 22:06:34.249000+00:00 - pietroborrello: We have a working lua script locally for Iron Bank but we are confused how we should deal with the initial part for `udp` and `print`
```
-- UDP is passed in as an arg
-- Print is passed in as an arg
local args = {...}
local udp = select(1  , ... )
local print = select(2, ... )
```
Do we have to keep it verbatim at the beginning of the script? Or do we have to fill the three dots? @SafeMode @Vito
2023-08-11 22:27:55.419000+00:00 - SafeMode: if you want this to work keep it as is
2023-08-12 02:50:43.649000+00:00 - meenmachine: Hey we got no script logs from you. Other teams received theirs.
2023-08-12 03:02:51.694000+00:00 - Capo80: how do we have no logs? we run several scripts
2023-08-12 03:06:24.783000+00:00 - meenmachine: We're investigating.
2023-08-12 03:15:03.026000+00:00 - meenmachine: What scripts do you guys believe you uploaded?
2023-08-12 03:15:14.258000+00:00 - meenmachine: Could you dump those scripts in chat please.
2023-08-12 03:20:38.692000+00:00 - dp_1: We sent some manual commands for the camera, and some scripts for script kiddie
2023-08-12 03:20:45.035000+00:00 - dp_1: we're looking for the scripts
2023-08-12 03:21:26.439000+00:00 - meenmachine: Okay awesome. Please send us what you have when you find it. Thank you
2023-08-12 03:22:45.771000+00:00 - Capo80: here
2023-08-12 03:23:03.660000+00:00 - Capo80: this are probably wrong, but we would like to understand why we don't see the output
2023-08-12 03:23:15.922000+00:00 - Capo80: as we have more important scripts in the following windows
2023-08-12 03:32:42.356000+00:00 - Cydonia: we've got copies of them. still investigating
2023-08-12 03:44:09.397000+00:00 - meenmachine: Hey. Do you need the logs for pass 42?
2023-08-12 03:44:20.253000+00:00 - meenmachine: So the first pass?
2023-08-12 03:44:53.751000+00:00 - meenmachine: https://finals.2023.hackasat.com/telemetry/42/42.zip
2023-08-12 03:44:58.011000+00:00 - meenmachine: If you do need it this is the link to that
2023-08-12 03:52:43.843000+00:00 - meenmachine: We see script execution in pass 44 for you all.
2023-08-12 03:53:20.754000+00:00 - meenmachine: There were still no scripts that ran in pass 42 and 43
2023-08-12 04:28:48.443000+00:00 - Cydonia: you scored script kiddie on one of your script executions. looking into why its not on scoreboard
2023-08-12 04:38:54.297000+00:00 - dp_1: Thank you for the update!
2023-08-12 13:07:57.622000+00:00 - pietroborrello: Hey @Cydonia we just realised the Iron Bank script we submitted does not put "mhackeroni" in the issue_challenge command, so in the log you will only see "User got the flag" in our timeframe and not "User mhackeroni got the flag". If this is the case would we still have the flag granted for the challenge?
2023-08-12 15:29:36.231000+00:00 - SafeMode: @pietroborrello we will check once we have data for that window what we can observe
2023-08-12 15:30:47.434000+00:00 - Cydonia: I'm on my way to the game floor, will have an answer soon
2023-08-12 15:31:25.032000+00:00 - Cydonia: Thanks for your patience
2023-08-12 16:01:47.821000+00:00 - meenmachine: The challenge is working as intended.
2023-08-12 16:17:21.350000+00:00 - drw0if: Can @orsobruno96 join this channel?
2023-08-12 16:17:53.999000+00:00 - meenmachine: done
2023-08-12 16:20:35.545000+00:00 - dp_1: so we should send a new try where the script sends "mhackeroni", or is the one we sent enough? assuming the rest of it is correct of course
2023-08-12 16:49:19.535000+00:00 - dp_1: Just had a look at the logs, we sent 3 script in window 44, but only see the output of 2. Are there any other logs we can use to double check, like submission logs?
2023-08-12 17:37:33.673000+00:00 - pietroborrello: @SafeMode @Cydonia @meenmachine is there any way to understand why our third script did not get upload on window 44? It was supposed to be a test run for iron bank and it would have been very useful to size the side channel iterations
2023-08-12 17:52:39.524000+00:00 - meenmachine: Looking into this
2023-08-12 18:07:41.713000+00:00 - carlomara: Answered in person, team is aware
2023-08-12 21:03:10.343000+00:00 - SafeMode: @mhackeroni You all asked us about images taken during window 43. The behavior we observed in TLM shows the game and challenges are working as expected. We can explain in more detail what happened after game.
2023-08-12 22:33:25.047000+00:00 - Cydonia: @Deadwood asked me to verify for u, 1 script submitted as part of your final plan
2023-08-12 22:45:39.598000+00:00 - dp_1: that is correct
2023-08-12 22:45:48.096000+00:00 - dp_1: and some camera commands
2023-08-13 22:09:39.837000+00:00 - dp_1: @Cydonia can we please get @daniele in here as well
2023-08-13 22:10:45.698000+00:00 - Cydonia: @meenmachine can you do this
2023-08-13 22:11:11.530000+00:00 - meenmachine: Done
